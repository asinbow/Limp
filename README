Limp's goal is to provide a compelling alternative to Slime for Vim. It will let you send s-expressions to a running Lisp.

It will do this for you:

* booting/attaching/detaching a Lisp (SBCL) from Vim or a command-line script, optionally specifying a core;
* send code to the attached Lisp (and limited introspection, see Help Describe);
* automatically close brackets;
* ease s-exp navigation and (some) transposing;
* highlight current form under the cursor;
* lookup documentation from the HyperSpec;
* complete (some) names.

Quickstart (better version with screenshots in the documentation):

In a file with "filetype=lisp" set, hit <F12> to invoke Limp and start a Lisp or connect to an existing.
Write a piece of code, e.g.:

  (defun hello-world (who)
    (format t "Hello, ~A!~%" who))

Place the cursor at any location inside the code and type <Leader>et (Evaluate Top) to send your code to the running Lisp.

Hit <F12> again to see the results!  Then, by placing the cursor at hello-world and typing <Leader>hd (Help Describe) followed by <F12>, you'll see information about the symbol!

To test it, type

  :Eval (hello-world '|Limp User|)

followed by <Enter> and <F12>.
