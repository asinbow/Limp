Broken in 0.3.1
==================
* can't start screen, i.e., <F12>, from gvim
* on `uname` == Darwin, SBCL is *usually* installed as /opt/local/bin/sbcl,
  and because of other issues in OS X, PATH is reset when doing the screen
  dance.

Should be changed in 0.3.1
============================
* only set nocompatible if not previously set (resets old settings)
* only set color scheme if none was already set

Wishlist
===========
* Start Lisp mode without opening up a lisp file; F12 should be clever enough
  to understand that.
